	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="5">The purpose of this website is to inform about immigration in the United States and on the current tab, about issues relating to immigration in the 21st century. <br> In the other tabs, history of immigration along with historic facts will be found, the dreamers situation and resources for those who need them are also available.

&nbsp 


	<h2 style="text-align: center;"><font size="6"> Immigration in the 21st Century </font></h2>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4">The 9/11 terrorist attacks led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security which took over many aspects of the immigration system in the nation. The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 are the same ones that govern the US on the early 21st century, although some modifications have been made to the latter. Those whoa rant born in the United States have 2 lawful ways to enter the country; one way is by receiving temporary admission and the other is permanent admission. Those that enter through permanent admission receive a green card which grants them the eligibility to work in the United States and eventually apply for Citizenship.</font></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4">Issues regarding immigration have also arisen as the presidency of Donald Trump has gone as far as to build a wall in the border with Mexico to keep people from crossing the southern border. It is estimated that this wall will cost the government around $70 billion dollars. However, the number of immigrants detained while trying to cross the border has only increased. Many argue that the highest reason of high numbers of illegal immigrants is that people overstay their visas, and statistics prove that.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4">Kids of immigrant families trying to cross have been greatly been affected by the stronger immigration policies. When families are caught at the border they are separated and put in detention facilities. This has caused a  strong rise of distress and riots rise by those who have seen that that the conditions in which immigrants are held at, specially kids, are inhumane. </font></p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;"> Policies, Removals and Foreign Born population in the 2000's</h2>

 	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> In 2002 the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act increase border patrol, require schools to report foreign students and require immigrants to carry IDs.</font></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> In 2005 the REAL ID Act comes into play which increases regulation for ID use and places more restrictions on those seeking political asylum and the "habeas corpus" relief. </font></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> In 2006, the Secure Fence Act called for the construction of 700 miles of high-security fencing, most of which was subsequently built. </font></p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> In 2012 unauthorized immigrants brought to the US as children allowed to stay through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals aka DACA. This was a milestone in immigration as its the closest the country has come to having a reform. (More about DACA in the DACA tab). </font> </p>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> In 2017 there's increased deportation through data sharing. The Secure Communities Program is re-instated in 2017 by executive order. Cuban refugees are no longer given legal residence. The new policy makes it so that Cubans entering without a visa are subject to deportation similar to other foreign nationals.</font> </p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4">It is believed that around 20,000 years ago the first humans stepped in America and from them stemmed the native tribes we know today and through history. In the year 1000, Vikings would arrive to this foreign land and thousands of years later European explorers would start the great European migration. Political and religious freedom was enough of a drive to put these different European groups on a 3 month sail on the roughest conditions. But Europeans were not the only group to migrate, black slaves were brought from West Africa. Servitude became a large part of American History and one that has left a lasting scar on the country. Slaves were also brought from the Caribbean.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> Thomas Paine, the author of Common Sense which influenced the minds of the people to support the American independence, stated that America would become "the asylum for the persecuted lovers of civil and religious library from every part of Europe." This is exactly what happened on the years coming. In 1790, Naturalization Act was passed which steeled that "...any alien, being a free white person, may be admitted to become a citizen of the United States..." Which clearly excluded a 20% of its population at that time: the black slaves. Immigration slowed down for a period of time  as England and franked faced conflict and the War of 1812 took place. However, it retook its pace in 1814, receiving immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland and Western Europe.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> As the Industrial Revolution began, more workers were needed in America to work on factories and the trans-continental railroad. As word got international about the California Gold Rush more immigrants, from both Asia and Europe, started entering the United States. During this time, the Potato Famine took place and cause many Irish immigrants to flee to America. Immigrants during this time period were welcomed as the economy thrived with their work and efforts. But when there were hard times, immigrants were blamed of stealing jobs. This debate over the acceptance and denunciation of immigrants caused different political views to rise.</font> </p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> This time period is characterized for the opening of Ellis Island which welcomed millions of immigrants to America. Europeans had easy passage through the quota system. However, Asian immigrants from China and Japan did not have it easy when entering the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act severely restricted immigration from China while the 1907 "Gentleman's Agreement" create no emigration from Japan to the US and the US would not impose restrictions on immigrants. Mexicans, jews and Armenians were 3 of the major groups that found refugee in America, away from the chaos in their home country. It is estimated that around 27 million people entered the US during this time and 12 million through Ellis Island. However, soon Americas views on immigration begin to change as major conflicts and upcoming wars would lead to suspicion of foreigners and the loyalty of immigrants would be put into question. In the 1920's, many laws were implemented to restrict the flow of immigration happening in America.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> The Great Depression took place during this time period, leading to an economic downfall and a sour taste for immigrants. This criss led to a decrease in immigrants and many even returned to their home countries. World War 2 would lead to even more restrictive immigration policies to the point that many refugees fleeing Nazi persecution were turned away. German and Italian aliens were detained, but the worst treatment was towards the Japanese and those of Japanese decent as their were put in internment camps. The Displaced Persons Act gave entry to thousands of refugee as a result of President Trumans urge for Congress to give protection to thousands of people who needed it. Hungarys failed uprising against the soviets led to the entry of 38,000 Hungarians into the United States. In the early 1960's the calls for reform were rising even more leading to the Hart-Cellar Act of 1965 which revoked the quota system that favored Western Europeans and now offered a welcome to immigrants from all continents.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> After the Hart-Cellar Act was passed, a dramatic change happened within the United States. Immigration from Asian countries quadrupled and Cold War conflicts caused many Cubans to flee to America. Within the next 3 decades of the acts passing, around 18 million immigrants had legally entered the United States. The legal methods of immigration fell upon those who brought their families from other countries, experienced violence or unrest in their home country or held skills necessary for the advancement of the United States. The change in demography was visible as the percent of Europeans lowered to a 16% of the population and 31% were of Asian decent. Mexicans became the largest group of immigrants followed by immigrants from the Philippines, Korea, the Dominican Republic, India, Cuba and Vietnam.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> However, illegal immigration was also arising, mostly through the land routes of Canada and Mexico. This led to the Immigration Reform Act of 1986 which provided better enforcement of immigration policies and more opportunities to seek legal immigration. This act brought 2 amnesty programs which granted amnesty to 3 million illegal aliens.</font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"><font size="4"> Immigration was slowed down in the early 1990s due to the economic recession and this added onto the emergence of anti-immigrant feelings. Those of other countries were willing to work for lower wages therefore creating competition for Americans. The Illegal Immigration reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act were passed in 1996 as a result which addressed border enforcement and social program use by immigrants.</font></p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center"> What is the Dream Act?</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was first introduced in 2001. The act looks to protect young immigrants who are prone to deportation. It applies specifically to certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children and went to school in America. However, for the past years since 2001 many versions of the act have been proposed yet none has become a law. The closest the bill came to pass was in 2010 where it passed the House of Representatives but fell 5 points below the 60 votes needed from the Senate. The most recent version of the Dream Act is the American Dream and promise Act of 2019 which would provide current, former, and future undocumented high-school graduates and GED recipients a three-step pathway to US citizenship. (For more information on this go to the resources tab)</font></p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center"> What is DACA?</h2>
	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> During his presidency, President Barack Obama created the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program aka DACA. This program temporarily relieves certain illegal immigrants from deportation and makes them eligible for working papers. Although the program only last fro 2 years, it can be indefinitely renewed. DACA has been able to provide almost  800,00 eligible young adults the opportunity work lawfully, attend school, and be bale to live their lives without the fear of deportation. The requirements to apply would be as follows: </font></p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>are under 31 years of age as of June 15, 2012</li>
  <li>came to the U.S. while under the age of 16</li>
  <li>have continuously resided in the U.S. from June 15, 2007 to the present</li>
  <li>entered the U.S. without inspection before June 15, 2012, or individuals whose lawful immigration status expired as of June 15, 2012</li>
  <li>were physically present in the United States on June 15, 2012, and at the time of making the request for consideration of deferred action with USCIS</li>
  <li>have not been convicted of a felony offense, a significant misdemeanor, or more than three misdemeanors and do not pose a threat to national security or public safety.</li>

	</ul>  

	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> However, on September 5, 2017 the new Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke revoked the 2012 DACA memo and announced a so called "wind down" for the program. Effective immediately no new applications were to be accepted. DACA beneficiaries whose status would expire before March 5, 2018 had the opportunity to renew for 2 more years by October 5, 2017. However, for those whose status expired by March 6, 2018 could no longer have deferred action or work authorization. </font></p>

	<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> On January 9, 2018, a federal judge in California blocked the termination of DACA and allowed for renewals to still be made. A similar decision was taken by a judge in New York who issued a preliminary injunction to prevent the administration from ending the program. Still, no new applications are being accepted. The requirements to renew are as follows: </font></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Did not depart the United States on or after August 15, 2012 without advance parole</li>
  <li>Has continuously resided in the United States since he or she submitted his or her most recent request for DACA that was approved up to the present time; and</li>
  <li>Has not been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanors, and does not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.</li>

</ul> 

<p style="text-align: center;"> <font size="4"> Even with the situation like this, states have taken it u[on themselves to protect their locals citizens and although they do not hold the power to legalize the status of undocumented immigrants, they are able to address collateral issues. For example, at least 19 state shave passed laws which would provide undocumented immigrants the opportunity to attain in-state tuition.</font></p>
